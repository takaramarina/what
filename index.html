        This is a list of anime that I have watched, annotated 
        with a small summary (mostly free of spoilers) as well 
        as my own thoughts. They are ordered by how much I 
        personally enjoyed them. To make it easier to gauge 
        the enjoyment of each show, they are given a letter 
        grade based on the following table:
        <br><br><br>
        <table class="grade-table">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>A</td>
              <td>God Tier</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>B</td>
              <td>Good Anime</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>C</td>
              <td>Eh</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>F</td>
              <td>Terrible</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>I</td>
              <td>Did not finish watching</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          <br>The grade I is not to be confused with a negative 
          rating; it is neutral on its own and can be given by 
          itself or in combination with another letter grade 
          depending on the level of completion. Anime with only 
          the grade I cannot accurately be placed within the 
          letter grade scale, so they are at the bottom of the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grades may further be divided with a + or - indicating 
          the relative rating of that anime within its letter 
          group. This will also be reflected in the position of 
          the anime in the list. Even if an anime has the exact 
          same letter rating as another, it can be assumed that 
          the one lower in the list was not enjoyed more than 
          the one above it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anime given a rating of A or higher will also be rated 
          on two further categories: romance and humor. These 
          ratings will be a score out of 5, represented by stars.
          Humor in this case is not necessarily a measure of the 
          funniness of the show. Rather, it indicates the level 
          of lightheartedness (“fuzake”) compared to the amount 
          of seriousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          These rankings are totally my own opinion influenced 
          by my own bias. My favorite genres are romance, comedy, 
          and sports, and my least liked genres are isekai/fantasy 
          and suspense/horror. I am not open to criticism.

            <br><br>Short boy dreams of becoming a great 
            volleyball player, then makes this into reality 
            when he meets a great team with a particularly 
            great setter. I’ve rewatched this so many times, 
            so the high ranking is probably a little sentimental, 
            but it's a great anime with a wide range of likeable 
            characters, satisfying plot (although repetitive, 
            but that's to be expected for a sports anime), 
            and a nice mix of humor and emotional moments. 
            There's also 4 seasons plus a bunch of OVAs, so 
            plenty of content to binge watch while we patiently 
            wait for a new season that may or may not be coming.
            The only complaint I have is that the animation in 
            season 4 is really sucky sometimes, but that was 
            when COVID first hit, so I will give them a break.

            <br><br>Childhood friends unexpectedly meet again 
            at a new workplace and fall in love, mostly due 
            to their shared identity as otaku. Green hair and 
            orange hair are also an otaku couple, but they seem 
            to express their love through arguments and bickering, 
            which is entertaining to watch and really makes it 
            special when they do have sentimental, lovey-dovey 
            moments. All three love arcs in this anime are quality.
            <br> Good subtitles from what I've seen, but there 
            are some internet slangs used in the show that aren't 
            translated at all.

            anime about a depressed burnout gifted kid finding 
            friends and fun in the countryside.

            A girl tries to confess to her crush, and he 
            thinks that she’s asking for his autograph because 
            he is actually a very famous manga writer (although 
            nobody at school knows). She becomes his assistant 
            in hopes that she can get close with him and make 
            him realize her feelings. He is dumb and blind and 
            is always looking for inspiration for his manga. 
            Actually, every single character in this anime is 
            remarkably clueless.

            However, she is hiding her gender and the fact 
            that she is actually there to repay the debt of 
            an expensive vase she broke on her first day as 
            a student. The blonde man is wildly in love with 
            her but doesn’t realize because he is stupid. 
            All the other hosts are charming and quirky in 
            their own way. Each episode is so ridiculous it 
            keeps you on your toes.

            Animation style changes in the middle and it's

            length. The manga might be better for English

            Old anime but classic for a reason. To be honest 
            this anime is probably ranked this high for 
            sentimental reasons, can be slow at times but is 
            still a really good show.

            erotic things going on. The boobs are big and 
            while I enjoy big boobs these boobs are too 
            distracting and unnecessary. But the plot is 
            pretty good, the son of some restaurant owner 
            makes his way up the ranks of a culinary school.

            really gross kimoi kind of way) and I simply did 
            not enjoy watching the show. Maybe there's a good

            when I am feeling up for it.
