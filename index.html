<h1>
  Anime Review
</h1>
<body>
  This is a list of anime that I have watched. They are ordered by how much I personally enjoyed them. To make it easier to gauge the enjoyment of each show, they are given a letter grade based on the following table:
  <table class="grade-table">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>God Tier</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>Good Anime</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>Eh</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>F</td>
        <td>Terrible</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>I</td>
        <td>Did not finish watching</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    The grade I is not to be confused with a negative rating; it is neutral on its own and can be given by itself or in combination with another letter grade depending on the level of completion. Anime with only the grade I cannot accurately be placed within the letter grade scale, so they are at the bottom of the list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Grades may further be divided with a + or - indicating the relative rating of that anime within its letter group. This will also be reflected in the position of the anime in the list. If an anime has the exact same rating as another, it can be assumed that the one lower in the list was not enjoyed more than the one above it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anime given a rating of A or higher will also be rated on two further categories: romance and humor. These ratings will be a score out of 5, represented by stars.
    Humor in this case is not necessarily a measure of the funniness of the show. Rather, it indicates the level of lightheartedness (“fuzake”) compared to the amount of seriousness.
  </p>
  <p>
    These rankings are totally my own opinion influenced by my own bias. My favorite genres are romance, comedy, and sports, and my least liked genres are isekai/fantasy and suspense/horror. I am not open to criticism.
