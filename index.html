  <body>
    This is a list of anime that I have watched. They are ordered by how much I personally enjoyed them. To make it easier to gauge the enjoyment of each show, they are given a letter grade based on the following table:
    <br><br><br>
    <table class="grade-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>A</td>
          <td>God Tier</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>B</td>
          <td>Good Anime</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>C</td>
          <td>Eh</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>F</td>
          <td>Terrible</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>I</td>
          <td>Did not finish watching</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <br>The grade I is not to be confused with a negative rating; it is neutral on its own and can be given by itself or in combination with another letter grade depending on the level of completion. Anime with only the grade I cannot accurately be placed within the letter grade scale, so they are at the bottom of the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grades may further be divided with a + or - indicating the relative rating of that anime within its letter group. This will also be reflected in the position of the anime in the list. If an anime has the exact same rating as another, it can be assumed that the one lower in the list was not enjoyed more than the one above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anime given a rating of A or higher will also be rated on two further categories: romance and humor. These ratings will be a score out of 5, represented by stars.
      Humor in this case is not necessarily a measure of the funniness of the show. Rather, it indicates the level of lightheartedness (“fuzake”) compared to the amount of seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      These rankings are totally my own opinion influenced by my own bias. My favorite genres are romance, comedy, and sports, and my least liked genres are isekai/fantasy and suspense/horror. I am not open to criticism.

            <br><br>Short boy dreams of becoming a great volleyball player, then makes this into reality when he meets a great team with a particularly great setter. I’ve rewatched this so many times the high ranking is probably a little sentimental.

Green hair and orange hair are also an otaku couple, but they have a love-hate relationship that is very entertaining. All three love arcs in this anime are quality.

            Boy from Tokyo is book smart but has no ambition in life. He gets sent to a rural af farming boarding school where he has to get used to the unexpectedly difficult world outside of the classroom. Subtle nuances of romance but overall wholesome anime about a depressed burnout gifted kid finding friends and fun in the countryside.

She becomes his assistant in hopes that she can get closer to him and make him realize her feelings. He is dumb and blind and is always looking for inspiration for his manga.

The blonde man is wildly in love with her but doesn’t realize because he is stupid. All the other hosts are charming and quirky in their own way. Each episode is so ridiculous it keeps you on your toes.

Kind of like Ouran but everyone is fighting for the girl. Super lighthearted and funny, comedic changes in animation style, pretty solid subtitles.

            Unassuming dumb looking young man is literally the fastest street racer alive other than his old man. Old anime but classic for a reason. To be honest this anime is partially ranked this high for sentimental reasons, can be slow at times but is still a really good show.

She slowly accomplishes this goal by befriending very quirky people at her school. Very wholesome, very humorous - the anime takes the lighthearted route rather than a serious one.

Meets new friends, makes a girlfriend, but memories fleet back sometimes - but new and old self can’t coexist, and he realizes that his new self will soon be erased. A little lacking in humor for my taste, it’s a pretty serious story.

            <br><br>Pretty solid plot but it’s kind of scary to watch by yourself haha lots of gore tbh oh yeah it’s the netflix show where the people are dropped off on the roofs of buildings or whatever and then they have to run away from the masked people.

            <br>It was okay I guess. I don’t like seeing women fight over a mediocre man. Also there needs to be an actual ending where she figures out everything… Would rate higher if they come out with season 2 that has an actual ending.

            <br><br>I loved the manga but the anime wasn’t great, the animation style was really leaning to a manga reading experience rather than a smooth anime and it was a little too simple. But anyways it’s an ex-yakuza member who is now a loving stay-at-home househusband (I don’t think he has a kid yet but I don’t remember). Would recommend the manga but not really the anime.
